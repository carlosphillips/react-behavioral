      In this interactive essay we will be building an app
      that controls and monitors 3 different ovens. We will
      be building it using a paradigm called Behavioral
      Programming which is implemented using the{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/lmatteis/react-behavioral">
        react-behavioral
      </a>{' '}
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you haven't already seen the{' '}
      <a href="/">TicTacToe example</a> built with
      react-behavioral and showcasing how Behavioral
      Programming works more in detail, I suggest you check
      it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than concentrating on various aspects of the
      app we will focus all our attention on the behavior:
      when I click this button, this should appear and these
      3 other things should happen which in turn also make
      this other thing happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how the app currently looks. It's entirely
      "dormant" at this stage made simply of stateless React
      components.

      <Bakery />
