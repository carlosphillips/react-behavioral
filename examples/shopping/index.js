      An interactive essay on the development lifetime
      of a shopping application

      <strong>Abstract. </strong>
      In this essay I want to try and explore what are
      the most critical pain points that arise during
      the development of a complex system.
      Specifically I will explore through the
      development of a shopping app, that are current
      methods are ineffective when modeling a system
      that constantly changes. As a result we need to
      take a more radical approach that changes how we
      think of software development: have the
      computers adapt to how humans generally think
      about systems, rather than having humans adapt
      to how computers work.
